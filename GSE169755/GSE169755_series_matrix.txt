!Series_summary	"In this exploratory study, we used laser microdissection to extract dopaminergic neurons from 10 human SNpc samples obtained at autopsy in Parkinson’s disease patients and control subjects. Extracted RNA and proteins were identified by RNA sequencing and nano-LC-MS/MS, respectively, and the differential expression between Parkinson’s disease and control group was assessed."
!Series_overall_design	"2 groups of samples: Parkinson's disease and Control. 3 replicated samples per group. 6 analyses per group. 12 analyses for the study"
